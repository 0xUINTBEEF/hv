# HV - Experimental Hypervisor

A work-in-progress hypervisor for learning purposes, featuring a flexible VMX configuration system and comprehensive logging capabilities.

## Features

### VMX Configuration System
- Flexible configuration management for Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX)
- Customizable CPU features including preemption timer and unrestricted mode
- Advanced memory management with configurable stack sizes and huge page support
- Performance optimization options for TLB flush and caching
- Comprehensive debug options with CR/DR access monitoring
- Security features including NX, SMAP, and SMEP enforcement
- I/O control with configurable bitmap support

### Logging and Monitoring
- Multi-level logging system with configurable categories
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Debug exception handling
- Preemption timer support with customizable intervals

### Current Limitations
- APIC virtualization is preliminary (only TPR shadowing)
- Unconditional I/O exiting needs stability improvements

### Planned Features

#### Advanced Virtualization
- Full APIC virtualization support with x2APIC and interrupt remapping
- Nested page table (EPT) implementation with multi-level page walk optimization
- VMCS shadow support for nested virtualization
- Multi-VM support with resource isolation and dynamic partitioning
- VM snapshot and live migration capabilities with minimal downtime
- Dynamic resource allocation and scheduling with QoS guarantees
- Virtual device emulation (network, storage, USB)
- Support for hardware-assisted virtualization features (Intel VT-d, SR-IOV)
- Memory ballooning and page sharing between VMs
- Virtual TPM support for secure boot and attestation

#### Security Enhancements
- Hardware-assisted memory encryption using Intel TME/MKTME
- Secure VM isolation using Intel TDX technology
- Security violation detection and reporting with machine learning
- Advanced intrusion prevention system with real-time monitoring
- Secure memory deduplication with side-channel attack prevention
- Trusted execution environment integration
- VM-level encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Fine-grained access control and privilege management
- Security audit logging and compliance reporting
- Zero-trust security model implementation

#### Management & Monitoring
- Web-based management interface with responsive design
- Real-time performance monitoring with customizable dashboards
- Advanced debugging tools with source-level debugging support
- Resource usage analytics with predictive scaling
- RESTful API for automation and integration
- Command-line interface for scripting

- Integration with popular monitoring platforms

#### System Integration
- Live patching support for security updates
- Hot-plug device emulation for dynamic hardware changes
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux)
- Containerization support with OCI compatibility
- Storage integration with popular backends
- Network integration with SDN controllers
- Backup and disaster recovery integration
- Cloud provider integration (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Configuration management integration
- API gateway integration for microservices

#### Development Tools
